:arrow_forward:   I aspire to be: junior front end developer :fire:

*Working in gastro made me want to change the industry.
I knew that I couldn't run with plates all my life, even though I liked this job :) I came across an ad for a web development course and bought it - out of curiosity. That's how it started ... I've been studying intensively for over a year.
I studied alone for several months, and for 8 months I have been teaching under the supervision of an experienced mentor.*

I love mountains  :mount_fuji:  and I love traveling :earth_americas:!

*that's why I live in beautiful Switzerland, but I come from Poland.*
